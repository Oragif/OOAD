\section{Use cases}
Focus on interaction between users and the system.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \textit{\textbf{Actor -} An abstraction of users or other systems that interact with the target system.}
\end{figure}
Actors are an abstraction of people and other systems that activates a target system function.\\
The complete set of use cases determines all uses of the target system within the application domain.

\section{Find Actors and Use Cases}
Criterion for determening different actors is a dissimilarity of roles. If multiple roles appear the same to the system, they should be consolidated.

        \begin{description}
            \item[Goal:] person who owns an account. The account owner’s basic need is to make payments with their plastic card.
            \item[Characteristics:] The system’s users include many account owners, with different levels of experience and sophistication.
            \item[Examples:] Account Owner A feels insecure about using a plastic card as a form of payment. Owner A originally got a card be cause it was the only way he could get an ID card for his checks. Owner A only withdraws money from the ATM in emergency situations.
            \item[] Account Owner B is technologically curious and she uses the system often, optimally, and to the limit of its abilities. B has never had major problems in understanding the system’s possibilities, and also examines possibilities that are not obviously accessible.

\subsection*{Describe Use Cases}
Can be described with statechart diagram for a good overview or a use-case specification for more details. It should make use of abstraction, the goal is to collect many possible ways of using the traget system in a few well-chosen use cases.
